## Engagement README

**This is a modification of the original StreamSpot core for the DARPA engagement**

Build with `make optimized`. No external dependencies.

Sample execution:
```
cat training/infoleak_small_units.CDM13.ss | \
    ./streamspot --edges=training/infoleak_small_units.CDM13.ss \
                 --bootstrap=clusters/infoleak_small_units.CDM13.cl
```

   * Input edges in the StreamSpot format are read from STDIN.
   * Input can be piped in from Kafka using [sbustreamspot-cdm](https://github.com/sbustreamspot/sbustreamspot-train).
   * Training edges are read from a file with the `--edges` argument.
   * Bootstrap clusters are read from a file with the `--bootstrap` argument.
   * Boostrap clusters are generated by [sbustreamspot-train](https://github.com/sbustreamspot/sbustreamspot-train).
   * Output is written to STDOUT in the JSON PAAS format.
   * Diagnostic output is written to STDERR.
   * Output can be piped to Kafka with the `pipe_stdout_to_kafka.py` script

## StreamSpot README

This repository contains the core streaming heterogenous graph clustering
and anomaly detection code.

Before attempting execution, ensure you have the following available as two
separate files:

   * Edges: A file containing one edge per line for all input graphs in the
     dataset. A sample is provided as `test_edges.txt`. The edge file used
     for the experiments in the paper is available at [sbustreamspot-data][1].

   * Bootstrap clusters: A file describing the bootstrap clusters. A
     sample is provided as `test_bootstrap_clusters.txt`. Bootstrap clusters
     used for the experiments in the paper are available [here][2].

The output will contain a summary of the execution parameters, runtime, and
the graph cluster assignments and anomaly scores every 10,000 edges. This output
can be further analyzed in various dimensions with [sbustreamspot-analyze][3].

Compilation and execution has been tested with GCC 5.2.1 on Ubuntu 15.10.

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/sbustreamspot/sbustreamspot-core.git
cd sbustreamspot-core
make clean optimized
./streamspot --edges=test_edges.txt \
             --bootstrap=test_bootstrap_clusters.txt \
             --chunk-length=10 \
             --num-parallel-graphs=10 \
             --max-num-edges=10 \
             --dataset=all
```

To use a different dataset, change `test_edges.txt` and
`test_bootstrap_clusters.txt` accordingly.

## Parameters

Most parameter settings are via the command-line; details on setting
them can be viewed by running `./streamspot --help`.

A few parameters are set at compile-time and can be found in `param.h`.
